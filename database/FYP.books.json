That's because he's being raised by his miserable aunt and uncle who are terrified Harry will learn that he's really a wizard, just as his parents were.

But just as he's packing his bags, Harry receives a warning from a strange, impish creature named Dobby who says that if Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts, disaster will strike.\n\nAnd strike it does. For in Harry's second year at Hogwarts, fresh torments and horrors arise, including an outrageously stuck-up new professor, Gilderoy Lockhart, a spirit named Moaning Myrtle who haunts the girls' bathroom, and the unwanted attentions of Ron Weasley's younger sister, Ginny.",

  "description": "Even bad code can function. But if code isn’t clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nNoted software expert Robert C. Martin, presents a revolutionary paradigm with Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship. Martin, who has helped bring agile principles from a practitioner’s point of view to tens of thousands of programmers, has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code “on the fly” into a book that will instill within you the values of software craftsman, and make you a better programmer―but only if you work at it.\n\nWhat kind of work will you be doing? You’ll be reading code―lots of code. And you will be challenged to think about what’s right about that code, and what’s wrong with it. More importantly you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft.\n\nClean Codeis divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code―of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and “smells” gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code.\n\nReaders will come away from this book understanding\nHow to tell the difference between good and bad code\nHow to write good code and how to transform bad code into good code\nHow to create good names, good functions, good objects, and good classes\nHow to format code for maximum readability\nHow to implement complete error handling without obscuring code logic\nHow to unit test and practice test-driven development\nWhat “smells” and heuristics can help you identify bad code\nThis book is a must for any developer, software engineer, project manager, team lead, or systems analyst with an interest in producing better code.",

It's not just the upcoming O.W.L. exams; a new teacher with a personality like poisoned honey; a venomous, disgruntled house-elf; or even the growing threat of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Now Harry Potter is faced with the unreliability of the very government of the magical world and the impotence of the authorities at Hogwarts. Despite this (or perhaps because of it), he finds depth and strength in his friends, beyond what even he knew; boundless loyalty; and unbearable sacrifice.",

  "description": "The Unified Modeling Language has become the industry standard for the expression of software designs. The Java programming language continues to grow in popularity as the language of choice for the serious application developer. Using UML and Java together would appear to be a natural marriage, one that can produce considerable benefit. However, there are nuances that the seasoned developer needs to keep in mind when using UML and Java together. Software expert Robert Martin presents a concise guide, with numerous examples, that will help the programmer leverage the power of both development concepts. The author ignores features of UML that do not apply to java programmers, saving the reader time and effort. He provides direct guidance and points the reader to real-world usage scenarios. The overall practical approach of this book brings key information related to Java to the many presentations. The result is an highly practical guide to using the UML with Java.",
